# Sample Rmd assignment autograder for Gradescope

This is a first pass at adapting the R autograder script for use with Rmd file
submissions. It currently works, but doesn't have any good error checking for
the actual knitting process, and actually knits the Rmd file twice. I hope to
fix these issues soon, but for now those caveats stand.
